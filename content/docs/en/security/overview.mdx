## Security Overview

> Content coming soon.

Clouisle is designed with enterprise security requirements from the ground up. All business data, vectors, and model interactions stay within your network boundary.

### Security Principles

- **Data isolation** — No external data transfer by default
- **Defense in depth** — Multiple layers of access control
- **Audit everything** — Complete operation history with before/after snapshots
- **Encryption everywhere** — At rest and in transit

### Security Features
